# GreenPrint-Project
Made to calculate the amount of CO2 you emit based on certain products you use.

There are currently 263 million cars in the United States alone 
The vast majority of these are gas burning vehicles
Studies show that burning just one gallon on gasoline dumps 20 pounds of cO2 in the air creating massive amounts of pollution.

## How We Can Help
* With our platform you will be able to track how much you have been impacting the environment over the years 
* You will also be able to plan your next vehicle purchase to make sure you are getting the best fuel economy while producing the least amount of pollution
* We also aim to help corporations gauge how much pollution they will potentially produce in real time so that changes can be made to reduce this impact
* Our platform crunches the numbers and gives you an approximation of how much pollution is being pumped into the environment
